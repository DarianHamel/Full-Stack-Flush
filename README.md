## Project Summary and Vision
The main vision and goal of our project is to deliver the most engaging and fun gambling experience possible to all users.
[The main vision and goal of our project is to deliver a variety of games based on skill and chance enhancing their competitive gameplay experience with user credits.] --> Insinuate gambling but don't really say gambling 

OR

The main vision and goal of our project is to ensure that all of our users are gambling responsibly and are aware of the issues surrounding gambling addictions, while still delivering a fun and engaging gambling experience.

## Core Features
### 1. Card Games
One of the main features of our project will be card games. We plan to have blackjack as the main card game of our project but would also like to add some sort of miniaturized version of poker, similar to the video game Balatro.

### 2. User Accounts
There will be a user accounts feature in our project. User accounts can be created and then must be used to access the rest of the website. This feature will include functionality for registering an account, logging in or out of an account, and viewing some basic account information.

### 3. User Stats
To complement the user accounts feature, we will have a feature that allows users to track different statistics related to their own account. There will be a way for users to view their win/loss and profit/loss ratios, along with their transaction history showing their in/outflow of money.

### 4. Teaching Fundamentals
There will be a teaching/learning section on our website to teach users how to play the different games on our website. Things like basic blackjack strategy lessons or card counting lessons will be available here.

### 5. Leaderboard
Another feature that can complement our user accounts functionality is our leaderboard feature. There will be a leaderboard that displays the biggest winners on the website, based on users' win/loss ratio.

### 6. Roulette
There will be a roulette table game on our website as an alternative option to playing card games. It will be a simple roulette table that follows typical roulette rules and standards.

### 7. Slots 
There will be an interactive slot machine experience as another alternative option to playing card or pricey betting games. Users can enjoy watching the interactive slot machine spin different combination. 

### 8. Time Limit Reminders ?
*This is an extra feature I thought of in case we want to take be a more moral/ethical stance in our project overall. Could tie into our vision statement somewhere about how we're advocating for gambling addiction awareness ? idk like forcing reminders that tell people to take breaks or forcing pop-ups that remind people the dangers and risks of gambling and getting addicted. Could argue we're taking a stance of trying to force all gambling websites to follow some set of standards that warn people about the risks rather than trying to be as addictive as possible. Not really a realistic goal but could be interesting, or we could also just go the complete opposite route and say we want our site to be as addictive as possible LOL*

## Technologies
