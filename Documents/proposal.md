# Full Stack Flush Project Proposal

## Project Summary and Vision
Full Stack Flush is a gambling web application that functions as a form of entertainment, allowing users the ability to play table games and gamble responsibly from anywhere they please. The purpose of Full Stack Flush is to improve the gambling habits of all users, while still delivering a fun and engaging gambling experience. Users will be provided with safe and healthy gambling limits and information related to safe gambling through regular reminders. Users will be forced to implement limits on their money and time. Our goal is to set a new standard for all gambling platforms through the integrated ethical features that we plan to implement.

## Core Features
### 1. Blackjack Game
One of the main features of our project will be card games. We plan to have blackjack as the main card game of our project but would also like to add some sort of miniaturized version of poker, similar to the video game Balatro. The blackjack card game will be our first feature and is our initial main priority, and we will consider adding the poker minigame as one of our final features once we have finished the other higher priority features listed below.

### 2. User Accounts
There will be a user accounts feature in our project. User accounts can be created and then must be used to access the rest of the website. This feature will include functionality for registering an account, logging in or out of an account, and viewing some basic account information.

### 3. Safe Gambling
Users will be forced to set reminders and limits on their gambling, including money spend/bet limits along with time limits. Users will also be provided resources to better understand the risks of gambling. The safe gambling feature will be implemented at every corner of the website. We will continue to improve this feature after every other new feature is added. The ultimate function of this feature is to educate users on the risks of gambling, and provide them with as much information as possible related to gambling problems, gambling odds, and even their own personal gambling habits.

### 4. Teaching Fundamentals
There will be a teaching/learning section on our website to teach users how to play the different games on our website. Things like basic blackjack strategy lessons or card counting lessons will be available here. We will also provide the odds for winning at each of the games, so our users are as educated as possible.

### 5. Leaderboard
To complement the user accounts feature, we will have a leaderboard feature. There will be a leaderboard that displays the biggest winners on the website, based on users' win/loss ratio. This will help to keep the platform fun and engaging.

### 6. User Stats
Another feature that can complement our user accounts functionality is a feature that allows users to track different statistics related to their own account. There will be a way for users to view their win/loss and profit/loss ratios, along with their transaction history showing their in/outflow of money. This will also be the place that users can see their personal gambling habits and how frequently they are visitng and using the platform.

### 7. Poker Game
There will be a poker minigame similar to Balatro as discussed in the description of our first core feature.

### 8. Capacity Throughput
Our web application will be able to handle 50 concurrent users playing games with a total of 500 requests per minute.
