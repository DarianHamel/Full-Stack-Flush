# Full Stack Flush Project Proposal

## Project Summary and Vision
Full Stack Flush is a gambling website that functions as a form of entertainment, allowing users the ability to play table games and gamble responsibly from anywhere they please. The purpose of Full Stack Flush is to improve good gambling habits of users, while still delivering a fun and engaging gambling experience. Users will be provided with safe and healthy gambling limits and information through regular reminders. Users will be forced to implement limits on their money and time.

## Core Features
### 1. Card Games
One of the main features of our project will be card games. We plan to have blackjack as the main card game of our project but would also like to add some sort of miniaturized version of poker, similar to the video game Balatro.

### 2. User Accounts
There will be a user accounts feature in our project. User accounts can be created and then must be used to access the rest of the website. This feature will include functionality for registering an account, logging in or out of an account, and viewing some basic account information.

### 3. User Stats
To complement the user accounts feature, we will have a feature that allows users to track different statistics related to their own account. There will be a way for users to view their win/loss and profit/loss ratios, along with their transaction history showing their in/outflow of money.

### 4. Teaching Fundamentals
There will be a teaching/learning section on our website to teach users how to play the different games on our website. Things like basic blackjack strategy lessons or card counting lessons will be available here.

### 5. Leaderboard
Another feature that can complement our user accounts functionality is our leaderboard feature. There will be a leaderboard that displays the biggest winners on the website, based on users' win/loss ratio.

### 6. Time Limit Reminders / Safe Gambling
Users will be forced to set reminders and limits on their gambling, including money spend/bet limits along with time limits. Users will also be provided resources to better understand the risks of gambling.
