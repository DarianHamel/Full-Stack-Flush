# Coding Conventions

## File Names
All JavaScript files will use the PascalCase naming convention

## Variables
Normal variables will use the camelCase naming convention (primarily used)

Global variables and constants will use UPPERCASE letters

*There is an exception for naming variables in JavaScript as local variables are declared with ```const``` so they will still use camelCase for their naming conventions*

*Another exception is for any React component the const declared variable for it will use PascalCase since it is a file name*

## Functions
All functions will use the camelCase naming convention

## Comments
All functions will be commented with a block header that look like this

```
/*
Comment/explanation about the function here
*/
```

## Coding Principles
* Keep your methods short.
* Comment everything that would require time spent thinking.
* Declare your variabels as close as possible to the place where you will use them.
* Methods which can be split apart should be.

## Branching
Each feature will get a separate branch where all the work will be done to complete that feature.

We will also have a development branch that the features get pushed to before going to main.

A code review will be conducted by at least one other person before each feature is merged to the development and main branches.
